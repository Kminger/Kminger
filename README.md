Hi, I’m Kenny Minger
-
I graduated at Davenport University with a 3.89 GPA and earned a Bachelors of Sceince in Computer Science with a specialization in Artificial Intelligence in 2021.

I mainly learned and used C# through out my educational career; however, I have learned MATLAB during my time in college when it came to my specialty classes. Some extra time was spent on the side for learning Python, but I have not done a major project with it yet. 

When I was in high school I was apart of a website design team for Business Professionals of America where I was able to learn HTML, CSS, and some Bootstrap to build the website. For the Regional competition, we placed first. In the State competition we were in the middle out of 30 teams. Unfortunately, the website is lost to time and many accidental harddrive wipes. 

I’m interested in playing video games with my friends, learning new technologies, playing my trombone, and bowling. 

Email is the best way to reach me for any questions about me or the programs: kennymngr@gmail.com


This profile is mainly going to be used as a showcase of different assignments and projects I have done throughout the years for people like recruiters to see.
